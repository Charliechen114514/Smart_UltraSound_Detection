# Run up the project

Before Running the project, remember to setup the project, see the setup.md for more informations.

For short, you can run 

```
devtools --all
```

for both setup and executable! Or, you can do this by steps:

```
devtools --prepare # Using to setup runtime dependencies and requires
devtools --run	   # Run the program directly, if no --prepared to applied the modified in rcc and ui, things goes wrong! So devtools --all is recommended!
```

See more help by using devtools --help!
